Replace the "1.dic" file within the master folder with either the "Less" or "No" chatter document, depending on what you want.

LESS CHATTER INCLUDES:
	An every 15 minute message of how cool you are.

NO CHATTER INCLUDES:
	Comments only on head petting.

___
HOW TO:
	Rename whichever file to "1.dic" and replace the current file within the master folder. I'd suggest making a copy of whichever file you want to use before renaming.
